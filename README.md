## Fingerprint Authentication
This app uses fingerprint authentication to securely verify users and provide access to sensitive content, such as personal preferences or account settings. To use fingerprint authentication, you will need to have fingerprint recognition enabled on your device.

Follow these steps to enable fingerprint authentication on your Android device:

- Open Settings on your Android device.
- Scroll down and tap on Security or Biometrics and Security (this may vary depending on the device).
- Tap on Fingerprint or Fingerprints under the "Biometric" section.
- Follow the on-screen instructions to register your fingerprint. You will be asked to place your finger on the sensor multiple times to ensure itâ€™s properly registered.
- Once your fingerprint is registered, make sure to enable the option to use it for authentication.

2. Enable Fingerprint Authentication in the App
Once you have enabled fingerprint recognition on your device, the app will automatically detect it when you attempt to log in. Follow the steps below in the app:
- On the login screen, you will see an option to enable fingerprint authentication.
- Tap on the option to enable it.
- The app will prompt you to scan your fingerprint on your device.
- Once the fingerprint is verified, you will be logged in automatically for subsequent app uses without needing to enter a password.
